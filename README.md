# Boneyard-Showdown
A repository for the scripts created during the development of the game "Boneyard Showdown", made in Unity using C#.

1v1 local versus game for Windows and Mac developed for the WeeklyGameJam event with the theme: Reborn (September of 2017).

Two necromancers try to destroy each other's castle by collecting bones and summoning skeletons. The game can be played via keyboard or gamepad.

This game was made with a team of four people in four days.

All programming and Unity Editor Management done by me.
